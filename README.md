# To-Do-List-With-C
##Final project for C course
After completing C course . I was asked to write a code for a To-Do list using pointers and dynamic allocation to enable user to add and delete tasks as they want.

the project  has options :
1- add task 
2- update task or show all tasks
3- mark task as completed
4- Exit program

I used Code Blocks for IDE (integrated development environment) .

I used Struct / Pointers / dynamic allocation

I used setColor Function to change line colors and system("cls") to clear console screen for better UX.
